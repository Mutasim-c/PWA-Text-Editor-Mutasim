# PWA-Text-Editor-Mutasim

## Description

My task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app
is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
